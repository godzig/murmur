# Murmur: emergent soundscapes

Just poking around with a couple of js libraries I've wanted to play with. Goal is a playground for messing around with emergent properties of procedurally generated sounds. 

```
npm run dev -- --open
```

Using http://sonoport.github.io/prototyping-synths-with-AudioKeys.html
to try to figure out polyphony. 

I'm guessing it's a scope thing where AudioContext needs to be defined above bug and then have the timing passed?
