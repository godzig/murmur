# Murmur: emergent soundscapes

Just poking around with a couple of js libraries I've wanted to play with. Goal is a playground for messing around with emergent properties of procedurally generated sounds. 

```
npm run dev -- --open
```

trying and failing at [Svelte Context API](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/context-api) to get polyphony working.
