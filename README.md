# Murmur: emergent soundscapes

Just poking around with a couple of js libraries I've wanted to play with. Goal is a playground for messing around with emergent properties of procedurally generated sounds. 

```
npm run dev -- --open
```

Still working on getting polyphony working. Successfully created a single AudioContext, now to add multiple oscillators to the same AudioContext
